👋 Hi there! I’m **Vishesh Bajaj**—a passionate web developer, final-year engineering student, and tech enthusiast, currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree at Aishwarya College of Education, Jodhpur (affiliated with JNVU). I thrive on building impactful web solutions and exploring innovative technologies to solve real-world problems.


💻 My expertise spans across full-stack web development, with a focus on React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. Currently, I'm working on a series of exciting projects:

<ins>**Debugging Health**</ins> – An AI-enhanced hospital resource management system designed to optimize patient queuing, bed availability, and admissions, with city-wide integration capabilities.

<ins>**NGO Sathi**</ins> – A platform designed to connect users with NGOs across the city, acting as a “Google for NGOs” for easier access to resources and contribution opportunities.


🎓 I'm constantly learning and upskilling, applying my knowledge in real-time projects like these, and my ongoing participation in **SIH 2024**. I believe in clean code, efficient solutions, and harnessing the power of collaboration to bring ideas to life.
